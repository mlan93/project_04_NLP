# Project 04 - Media NLP Topics
**By Max Lan**

**Overview:**

The files within include 2 Jupyter notebooks, 2 python files, and a pdf. Reviewers should begin by reading "News_Dataset_cleaning-AWS.py", which details the data and cleaning performed as well as the LDA model. Reviewers should then read "News_Dataset_Main.ipynb", the primary file detailing rationale, modeling, visualizations, and other considerations.

"Readability_score.py" and "Model_Topic_Evaluation.ipynb" are supporting notebooks detailing the calculation of reading score metrics and pyLDAvis visualization code, respectively.

"Project_04_ML.pdf" is the presentation slide file.
